## Structure of txt files of Multilingual TEDx (mTEDx) dataset
The original videos downloaded from the mTEDx website are provided as a form of not-trimmed things. Therefore, you should trim the videos to contain only the speaker. For this purpose, Pingchuan Ma manually cleaned the French corpus and provided the file of video lists. Additionally, we use only under 20 seconds of videos in these provided files to train the VSR model.

The format of *.txt file is as follows:
line i : Video name  start_sec  enc_sec  transcription
(e.g., line 1 : 0u7tTptBo9I_0004	42.91	45.26	et pourtant on vient tous de loc√©an)
